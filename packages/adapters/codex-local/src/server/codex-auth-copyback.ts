 *   3. Run the Phase-3 decision predicate (`source` = sandbox temp, `destination`
 *      = host). Exit 10 → adopt the sandbox copy; exit 20 → keep the host copy.
 *   4. On exit 10, `rename` the staged temp over the host target — an atomic
 *      same-directory swap that preserves mode `0600`. On exit 20, discard it.
 * The staged temp is always removed (rename consumes it on the copy path; the
 * finally cleans it up otherwise), so a failure never leaves a partial file.
