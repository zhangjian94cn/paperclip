// The Claude `setup-token` login runner. It starts `claude setup-token` through

// in memory, accepts one browser code, sends the code to the matched prompt, and
// delivers the minted OAuth token one time. It handles a timeout and a
// cancellation, and it stops the child for every terminal state.
//
// Security (secret handling): the runner treats every byte of the terminal
// stream as secret-bearing, untrusted input. It parses the stream in an in-memory
// buffer only. It drops the prompt buffer as soon as it finds the prompt, and it
// drops the token buffer as soon as it binds the token. It never forwards the raw
// text to a log or an artifact, and it never stores the raw text on the result.
// The runner reports only a fixed, non-secret status. It passes the prompt one
// time through the in-memory `onPrompt` callback. It reads the browser code one
// time through the in-memory `provideCode` callback and writes the code only to
// the child, only after it matches the prompt. It delivers the token one time
// through the in-memory `onCredential` callback. The runner keeps the URL, the
// code, and any token byte out of every log line and every thrown error.
//
// Token delivery binds to the success record. The runner scans the post-prompt
// stream with {@link parseSetupTokenCredential}, which returns the token only
// from the exact success record. The {@link SETUP_TOKEN_CREDENTIAL_RELEASE_GATE}
// stays open only while a caller provides an `onCredential` sink; without a sink
// the runner never scans for the token.
