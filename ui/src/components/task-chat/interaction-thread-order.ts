/**
 * Thread-ordering + visibility rules for issue-thread interaction cards
 * (PAP-416, Phase A of PAP-412).
 *
 * Two problems this fixes:
 *
 *  1. Cards were pinned to `createdAt`, but the user answers them later and the
 *     agent's follow-up lands later still — so a card you just resolved could
 *     sit ABOVE a message written before you answered, reading backwards. We
 *     settle a RESOLVED card at its resolution time (`resolvedAt`) so it never
 *     floats above an earlier message. Pending cards stay where they were asked.
 *
 *  2. Withdrawn / superseded confirmation cards lingered in the thread, stacking
 *     a dead card above the accepted one. We suppress those from the backbone
 *     entirely — a retracted or superseded confirmation is not a call to action
 *     and reads as noise next to the outcome that replaced it.
 */
